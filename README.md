## Tulia's Adventures

The protagonist Tulia is my female persona, which found herself in a dark forest at night and has to escape from some elemental golems that are lurking in the woods.   


## About the game

This is a simple game made with Javascript and the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) drawing library. It was coded alongside a crash course called [Javascript Game Dev](https://www.alura.com.br/imersao-gamedev-javascript). However, only the wider idea was followed so the code is completely made by myself. 


## Screenshots and how to play

You shall dodge the enemies using the keyboard arrow up key. You have a limited number of lives and a score that keeps incrementing itself. The goal is simply to get the highest score possible.
